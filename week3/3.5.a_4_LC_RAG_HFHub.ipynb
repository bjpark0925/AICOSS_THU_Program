    "## The RAG idea\n",
    "\n",
    "*Retrieval-Augmented Generation* or *RAG* in short, is a technique used in natural language processing, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs). It combines the power of neural network-based language generation with information retrieval methods to enhance the model's ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of RAG include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combination of Retrieval and Generation**: RAG models consist of two main components: a retrieval system and a sequence-to-sequence model. The retrieval system first searches a large dataset or knowledge base to find relevant information or documents. Then, the sequence-to-sequence model (like a transformer-based language model) generates responses based on both the input prompt and the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improving Information Accuracy and Relevance**: By directly referencing specific information from relevant documents, RAG models can provide more accurate and detailed responses, especially for questions that require factual information or external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use in Question Answering**: RAG is particularly useful in question-answering systems where precise and up-to-date information is crucial. It enhances the model's ability to answer questions that might be beyond its original training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can be used in various applications such as chatbots, search engines, and virtual assistants, where the integration of real-time information from various sources can significantly enhance performance and user experience. Also, this can be done in connection with locally hosted LLMs, so the method is well suited if the data is private and should not be shared over the internet. For demonstration purposes we will here once again use the HuggingFace hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we will need a *vector database* which allows to store the embeddings and helps in *efficient retrieval* of the relevant documents in order to provide the LLM with the necessary context for answering the question at hand. The whole approach is visualized below, where the image is taken from the master's thesis entitled *Using Large Language Models to assist in the creation of a GDPR documentation* by Magdalena von Schwerin."

    "LangChain provides many ways to retrieve data and use it to augment the LLM's knowledge base.  It provides an interface of `Retriever` that returns documents given an unstructured query. Retriever is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are [other types of retrievers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) as well, such as Amazon Kendra.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on vector store-backed retriever in this notebook, but you can try others yourself."

    "## Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, our LLM still does not pick up on the bullet point we are looking for. This calls for some *prompt engineering*. Here is what ChatGPT 4 has to say about this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt engineering** in the context of LLMs refers to the skillful crafting of input prompts to effectively communicate with and extract desired responses or behaviors from the model. It involves understanding how these models process and respond to language, and using this knowledge to create prompts that are more likely to lead to accurate, relevant, or creative outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of prompt engineering include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Being clear and specific about what you want the model to do. Vague or overly broad prompts can lead to unpredictable or irrelevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context and Detail**: Providing sufficient context or detail for the model to understand the request and generate a relevant response. This might involve framing the question or request in a certain way or providing background information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instructional Prompts**: Using prompts that explicitly instruct the model on the format or style of the desired response, like asking it to generate a list, explain a concept step by step, or write in a particular tone or style.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterative Refinement**: Experimenting with different formulations of a prompt to achieve better results. This can involve tweaking the wording, adding or removing information, or changing the structure of the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoiding Biases and Errors**: Being mindful of potential biases in the model's training data and crafting prompts that minimize the risk of eliciting biased or harmful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is particularly important because LLMs are trained on vast datasets of human language and can generate a wide range of responses based on how a question or request is phrased. Effective prompt engineering can greatly enhance the utility and accuracy of these models.\n",

      " Yes, the model type is described as \"direct distillation of LM alignment.\" This refers to a specific technique used in the development of the model, which involves training it to closely mimic the behavior of a larger, more sophisticated language model (known as a \"pre-trained\" model) in a process called \"distillation.\" The idea is to compress the knowledge and capabilities of the larger model into a smaller, more efficient one while preserving its performance on various language tasks. In the case of Zephyr-7B-beta, the larger model being distilled is not explicitly named, but it is likely to be a variant of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, which has been widely used as a starting point for many other LLM projects. The \"β\" in the model name indicates that it is an experimental version of the model, and may not have undergone the same level of testing and validation as the final, production-ready version. Overall, the direct distillation technique is a promising approach for creating smaller, more specialized LLMs that can perform specific tasks efficiently and accurately, while preserving the high-level understanding and flexibility of the larger models they are based on. However, as noted in the model description, there are limitations to this approach, particularly when it comes to more complex tasks like coding and mathematics, which may require more specialized training or architectures.\n"
