Bribe your way onto early departures, but don't let yourself go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping rough and begging for aid! Trade items for profit, and collect the equipment for the conditions you'll face: but too much luggage will slow you down...\n\n80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that never stops running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons, boats, camels, horses and more leave and arrive minute by minute. \n\nEvery city and journey is narrated via an interactive story where you control every action. Will your choices speed you up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your time? Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await! \n\nThe app is network-connected, with a live feed that shows you the position of all the other players of the game, their routes, triumphs and disasters. You can race to be the fastest - or look ahead to learn the secrets of the world.\n\nShare your own journey with friends, and load other's routes directly into your app so you can race head-to-head.\n\n* \"We\u2019ve been dreaming about this future for decades.

The app was developed in collaboration with psychologists who have long experience of using the low arousal approach and working with persons displaying behaviours of concern.\n\nThe Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommends the low arousal approach in the treatment of people with inadequate affect regulation, in order to, in the moment, prevent or reduce behaviours of concern. This may involve, for example, people with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD. It can also involve children who are developing, and in their attempts towards independence have difficulties with affect regulation.\n\nThe app can be used by professionals or parents who need help to see patterns in everyday life and by doing that try to create changes that reduce unwanted behaviours and increase positive interactions.\n\nThis is a tool that facilitates tracking of severe behaviours of concern and outbursts that disrupt daily life. Warning behaviours, which are a bit lower in their level of arousal, but still signal that everything is not going smooth, may also be tracked using the app. After a period of use, it will be possible to see if there are days or times of the day where outbreaks and chaos are recurring. If you make changes in everyday routines or in response to a conflict situation, you can, after some time, find out if the changes have had an effect on the amount of outbursts.\n\nBy using the tool, working proactively and managing behaviours of concern using the low arousal approach, we can avoid serious conflicts and dangerous restraints. The low arousal approach is a method that protects the right of children and functionally-challenged individuals not to be subjected to practices that are dangerous or that can be perceived as offensive.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to understand and deal with behaviours of concern, you can read the literature by among others, psychologist Bo Hejlskov Elv\u00e9n, about the low arousal approach and behaviour of concern.\n\nThe founders of the website \"Pedagogiskt kapital\", Daniel Elv\u00e9n and Carita-Li Smyth, together with other psychologists, want to provide different perspectives on how we can solve problems in a way that increases people's experience of participation and security.\n\nIMPORTANT: Handle collected data with care since it can contain personal information."}, {"name": "Bemanager - Be a Soccer Manager", "description": "Bemanager is an online Soccer Manager where you compete with friends or against other users around the world to win the league.

There were few places you could go to safely without causing some sort of scandal, and even fewer people who were willing to listen with understanding. \n\nMaybe it was the rhythm and blues saturating the basements of late night entertainment. Maybe it was a society lifting out of the Great Depression, with more tolerance accompanying their more affluent life styles. Maybe it was the boldness of writers, spokes people and celebrities campaigning for civil rights, but by the 1960\u2019s, interracial dating slowly became more acceptable. \n\nThe changing times brought its own set of problems. Even as the work force became more integrated, with minorities and women stepping into roles once designed for white, professional males, and public places ceased separating or refusing services to minorities, interracial dating was still awkward. It was an era of general agreement on civil rights, but there weren\u2019t very many among the Depression Years parents who were prepared to bring racial integration into the home. \n\nThe Millennial Perspective\n\nThe awkward early years of racial integration jump-started interracial dating. Today, seven percent of the population claims a mixed race heritage. The number is growing rapidly, with most interviewee\u2019s stating pride in their multiracial origins and claiming their heritage has made them more open to other cultures. \n\nSeven percent is significantly higher than in the 1970\u2019s, when only one percent declared a mixed race background, but analysts feel these number are actually only about half the actual percentage, as many who are mixed race claim only one ethnic background. The majority of those who claim only one race are middle-aged or older. \nFrom Age to Regional Location\n\nThe younger you are, the easier it is to find a partner for interracial dating. The twenty to thirty year old set are generally very casual and already have a wide mixture of multi-cultural and multi-racial friends. Tolerance, however, especially by family and community, can vary greatly according to demographics. In many areas, especially regions that historically disapproved of mixed race dating, there may no longer be taboos, but the cultural clash still exists. The family, and even your date, might have stereotypical views of your personal tastes and behaviors. \n\nCrossing the barriers where racial misconceptions still exist takes fortitude and patience. Interracial views are changing rapidly but not racial views. You may experience those uncomfortable moments of somebody going out of their way not to offend you, anxieties concerning appropriate behaviors, or even suspicion and reserved behaviors. \n\nUnless you are dating someone with exactly the same historical background, social status and religion, you are still going to be challenged by your date\u2019s customs. For many races, the customs are more engrained than color, status or ancestral origins. Religion may be an important influence on their lives, even if they no longer declare a religious preference, as they will make time for the traditional values of their family. \n\nBut that\u2019s part of what interracial dating is all about. It\u2019s an opportunity to take a broader look at the world around us, to improve our communications with others, and learn about differing cultures and customs that can enrich our everyday lives.\n\nBlack white color app is open to all singles, gay, lesbian or bisexual, all ages, teens, over 40s,over 50s mature or seniors, all races, black, white, mixed, Asian, Indian, Hispanic, Mexican, Latina...

There are 5 rounds in a game. Players' sitting direction and the first dealer are selected before the first round begins. To randomize player's sitting direction and the first dealer, each player draws a card from the deck, and based on the order of the cards, their directions and first dealer are fixed. Dealers are changed successively in anti-clockwise direction in the following rounds.\n\n\nDeal\nIn each round, a dealer starting from their right, deals all the cards in anti-clockwise direction to all the players without revealing any card, making 13 cards per each player.\n\n\nBidding\nAll four players, starting from the player to dealer's right bid a number of tricks that they must win in that round in order to get a positive score, otherwise they will get a negative score.\n\n\nPlay\nIn Callbreak, Spades are the trump cards.\nIn each trick, player must follow the same suit; if unable, player must play a trump card if eligible to win; if unable, player can play any card of their choice.\nPlayer must always try to win the trick, in other words (s)he must play higher cards possible.\n\nThe first trick in a round is led by player to dealer's right with any card of any suit. Each player, in turn plays in anti-clockwise direction. A trick containing a spade is won by the highest spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the same suit. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick.\n\n\nScoring\nPlayer that takes at least as many tricks as her bid receives a score equal to her bid. Additional tricks (Over Tricks) are worth an extra 0.1 times one point each. If unable to get the stated bid, score will be deducted equal to the stated bid.

The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ\u2013scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!"}, {"name": "Care Bears Music Band", "description": "Time to play with your favorite Care Bears!

There is 50% higher risk of these patients being hospitalized and 20% more likely to seek care within 72 hours after discharge.\n\nIncreased costs\nMisdiagnosis, mistreatment, complications, prolonged hospitalization and increased readmissions all increase costs for healthcare providers. In addition, healthcare professionals are likely to take more samples and do more research on patients who do not master the language.\n\nABOUT US\nThe goal is to make healthcare better for all: Care to Translate, earlier called \u2018Spr\u00e5k i v\u00e5rden\u2019, was founded as a non-profit in the fall of 2015 by medical students from Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and today it has become one of the most used translation tools in the Swedish healthcare sector.\n\nHowever, the issue that \u2018Spr\u00e5k i v\u00e5rden\u2019 was addressing is neither an easily solved problem, nor a problem limited to Sweden. It affects people all over the world, and to be able to work on it with full devotion, the company Care to translate AB was formed in 2018.

It helps people to slow their rate of speech down which makes it sound clearer to others. \n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional is the most effective and efficient Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) currently on the Android Market. No other app delivers the low latency required for effective use.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used. \n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stutter / stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010). \n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups. However, DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions. \n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nIf you encounter any problems then please email to support@speechtools.co and we will do our very best to help you."}, {"name": "DC Legends: Battle for Justice", "description": "YOU CAN\u2019T SAVE THE WORLD ALONE - Join your favorite Justice League heroes and villains in epic RPG combat. \n\nRecruit Justice League heroes like Batman, Superman, The Flash, Wonder Woman and more in the ultimate DC experience.

The Game is very simple:\n1- One of the two players will deal four cards for each, and in the beginning of the game he will include the ground with four ground two.\n2- Each player will throw one card to the ground until he is out of cards, then the dealer will deal again four cards each but not for the ground.\n3- Player goal is to take from the ground as many cards as he can. After the Dealer is out of cards. Each pile the players took through the game will be counted and the player who got the most cards will get the points. The other will be zero.\n4- What the player can take from the floor is either there is on the ground a similar card to what he has, or group of cards representing the sum in numbers to a card of his hand, the J, Q, and K are not included in the sum:\n- e.g. there are four cards on the floor A (have a value of 1), 7, K, and 8; if you have card 8 in your hand you will take 3 cards, the 8 and the 1+7 which equal the 8. or if has 9 he can take 8+1. If you have card K in your hand you will only take the K from the ground.\n5- If there is (card J or Diamond 7) in your hand you will take all the cards from the ground.\n6- when the ground is empty and next player throw one card of his hand (of course he will be careful not to throw J or diamond 7, these are special as demonstrated), If the other player have similar card in his hand he will take the card from the ground as additional bonus as called by Egyptians \"Basra\".\n7- the other situation to take \"Basra\" is when all the cards on the ground sum to one card in his hand in addition to any similar card have the same sum value:-e.g. the ground cards are (10, 5, 4, 1) and the player has 10, or (8, 7, 1) and the player has 8 ... etc.\n8- Also in the previous situation happens and the player has diamond 7 he will take the cards on the ground as \"Basra\". Diamond 7 is special card that has 2 roles called by Egyptians \"Al Komi\"; the other name of the same game; it will take basra of any value or as the J take all the ground.\n9- Be careful not to hold the J or Diamond 7 as last card in your hand as the other player may take the whole ground and burn your J or Diamond 7, as he will take either of them as \"Basra\" next time he play.\n10- If the dealer is out of cards, its time to count the cards which only the player with most of the cards will take this point. Also the number of Basra taken by the two players will be counted and both will take the Basra bonus.\n11- Several rounds will continue in which the two players will exchange the dealing role and the other player will start first until the target score is reached, and the winner announced."}, {"name": "EliteSingles: Dating App for singles over 30", "description": "Looking for a great dating app for singles 30+?

This makes maths fun.\n\nAN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM\n\nSeparating and combining numbers are important foundations to develop calculation strategies.

Become a great viking and write your name in the history of ancient Scandinavia in the world of Frostborn!\n\nFrostborn is a new cooperative RPG where everyone will find a lot of ways to entertain themselves, for example, invite three more friends to play in cooperative mode or unite with other players into a clan to jointly build a base, attack enemies and so much more!\n\nAt the base, you will be able to store resources and properties, and also play defense from attacks of foe clans and enemies. For that you will need strong thick walls, various traps and a little bit of tricks. Don\u2019t let strangers invade into your territory!.. Or break into bases of others and carry out a massacre! \n\nEspecially since there is a wide range of weapons and artifacts in Frostborn, each of which serves for a set mission with varying levels of hard hit. Even if you tend to change weapons like socks throughout the game, it will take a while to decide which ax or club is more fun to pile up corpses! \n\nGame features:\n* Realistic graphics\n* Co-op mode up to 4 players\n* PvP and PvE modes\n* Create or join a clan\n* Build a collective base\n* Vast in-game world\n* Plenty of locations and dungeons\n* Wide range of weapons\n* Rich craft system\n* Craft in-game transport\n* Spectacular world in the setting of ancient Scandinavia\n* Atmospheric sound design\n\nFrostborn stands out not with just outstanding graphics, but also extremely picturesque world - Ingard, an emerald land, strewn with lakes and dwelled by various animals. Yet breathtaking landscapes of Ingard are far from welcoming -- these lands are now flooded with hordes of the living dead!\n\nOnce these creatures got to the world of the living through the gate opened by Hel, the goddess of death. She took revenge on Odin, the ruler of Frostborn, for sending her to the underworld -- Helheim. Unable to leave the world of the living and pass over into Helheim, the undead get to Ingard through the rifts between the world of gods and the world of humans. \n\nThe few survived vikings summoned up all their strength and courage to exile evil from Ingard and return Thor and Odin\u2019s grace - this is where your epic quest in Frostborn begins! The battle will be hard, worthy of true norse warriors! \n\nNote that in Frostborn you can choose the game pace that fits you best: leisurely fit out your base crafting items, placing plants, fireplaces and sofas, or jump on a carriage (in-game transport) and go to the external world to plunge into hunting of wild animals, killing the undead and fighting with other players. \n\nOpen all in-game locations that include: dangerous underground sanctums of Thor and Odin, Cursed Forests, Sacred Trees and Winter\u2019s Gate -- the only pass to the northern lands where frost giants are believed to live. But be careful - apart from obvious dangers hidden in the lands of Ingard, you can also face other daredevil players...\n\nFrostborn is a beautiful, serious, relatively complex and modern game with great mechanics and an interesting storyline. Unravel all the mysteries, defeat Hel and save Ingard!

Could you find a light in the dark maze of human consciousness? Could you remember the story?\n\n\nINNOVATIVE PUZZLES THAT ARE THE STORY\n\nEach level sparks a little memory of the person\u2019s life. It\u2019s a two-part puzzle: a visual image of the memory and a telescopic text, that reveals itself with every step. You start with fragmented pieces of the picture attached to dashed lines. Dragging them like strings, you move parts of the image to restore it. In turn, telescopic text reacts to your every step \u2013 the closer you are to the solution, the more text unfolds. And if you're not moving in the right direction, the story piece too can drift away from the truth. You are indeed remembering \u2013 adding details to the memory and forming a clear picture.\n\nRELAXING AND ATMOSPHERIC\n\nThe game has a delightful relaxing flow with the atmospheric music and haptic feedback - all this helps you to dive into this compelling story even more. No scores, no timers, no \"game over\".\n\nA DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS STORY\n\nG30 is about memory and consciousness \u2013 and what they mean for a human being. There are people around who are losing their ability to remember \u2013 some kinds of mental diseases do that to a person.

It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.\n\nThe Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.\n\nNet carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.\n\nBMI is used to assess health risks and body structure but does not take in consideration muscular mass so it can sometimes be inaccurate, for instance in the case of athletes or pregnant women.\n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.\n\nHyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglyc\u00e6mia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma."}, {"name": "Goat Simulator", "description": "Goat Simulator Free is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU.

These;\n\u00a0- A: 11, 10:10, K: 4, Q: 3, J: 2 points.\nCertain card groups have a certain score. Each player turns out to reveal the cards that the group can do. This way they get points before starting the game. The card groups are as follows;\n\u00a0- Marriages: Marriage is the name of the same kind of K and Q cards come side by side. The type of non-Koz is 20 and the trump is 40 points.\n\u00a0- Team: If all types K and Q come side by side, it is called a team. It earns 240 points.\n\u00a0- Pinik: If spades Q and Karo J come in, it is called pinic. 40 points.

However, there are only certain differences in the game as there are only A-10-K-Q-J cards. The card order is from A to 10> K> Q> J. So it takes 10, K and gold. If the same cards are scored, the first one is the winner. For example, if 3 of the same types of A are eliminated, the first one who gets it will be his.\n\n\u00a0GAME OVER\n\u00a0At the end of the game, the points of the cards are collected. The player who gets the last hand takes an extra 20 points. If the player receiving the auction does not score as much as his bid, he will receive a negative score up to his bid."}, {"name": "Hue Essentials - Philips Hue & IKEA TR\u00c5DFRI", "description": "Imagine unlimited possibilities in your smart home.

But MyTherapy is more than a free medication reminder: Combining a pill tracker, mood tracker and a health journal, e.g. with a weight tracker, this medication reminder app allows you and your doctor to put your treatment\u2019s success into perspective. \u23f0 \ud83d\udc8a\ud83d\udd14\n\n\ud83d\udc8aKey Features \n\u2022 Pill reminder app for all medications\n\u2022 Pill tracker with logbook for skipped and confirmed intakes\n\u2022 Support for wide range of dosing schemes within medication reminder\n\u2022 Track your tablets, dose, measurements, activities as a comprehensive health journal\n\u2022 Family sharing\n\u2022 Share your printable health journal with your doctor\n\u2022 Wide range of measurements for all conditions (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, hypertension, multiple sclerosis) e.g. weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels\n\n\u23f0Comprehensive meds reminder \nWe designed a medicine reminder app that puts all your medication needs in one place: Pill reminders (e.g. for birth control pills), a comprehensive database of OTC and Rx medications, support for any dosage form (tablet, pill, inhalation, \u2026) frequency, and even refill reminders. And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you\u2019ve taken that important dose. \n\n\ud83d\udc8aA health tracker for your needs \nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\n\n\u23f0A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app\u2019s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app\u2019s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n\ud83d\udc8aMotivation to take your meds\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine.

Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits\u2728. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f HOW SLEEP BOOSTER WORKS\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Falling asleep:\nDeep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Sleep retention:\nBreathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Awakening:\nAfter a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. Smart alarm analyzes your sleeping schedule and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f WHY DO YOU NEED SLEEP BOOSTER?\n\nAsk yourself the following questions: \n\u2753 Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep?\n\u2753 Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up? \n\u2753 Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day?\n\u2753 Are you struggling to stay organized? \n\u2753 Do you feel so tired that all you can think about is sleep?\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you can definitely benefit from using Sleep Booster app for sleep and well-being improvement.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience.

In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones.

Then Vethem can help you assess the situation and help with non-urgent problems. With the Vethem app installed in the phone, you always have a veterinarian at your disposal if the accident occurs.\n\nThis is how the video call works with a veterinarian\nBefore the video call, the veterinarian will go through your case and prepare for the meeting with your animal. You can help the veterinarian to prepare by describing the matter thoroughly when booking time.\n\nWe relate to the Swedish Board of Agriculture's rules and recommendations regarding prescription prescription.\n\n- Antibiotics and sedatives\nVethem's policy is not to print any drug containing antibiotics. To counteract unnecessary spread of antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria is important and high priority in both animals and people in Sweden. Therefore, we refer to sampling if we judge that your animal may need antibiotics.\nVethem also does not prescribe soothing medicines to your animal. Calming drugs can affect your pet's circulation. It is therefore important that the animal is examined physically, by listening to the heart and lungs, before the veterinarian prescribes sedative drugs."}, {"name": "ViewRanger: Trail Maps for Hiking, Biking, Skiing", "description": "Discover inspiring trails, download offline maps, and navigate with confidence on your next hike, bike ride, backpacking trip, ski holiday, or outdoor adventure.

See below for device-specific info, or visit http://wearablewidgets.com/devices.html\n\n\u2022 This free app supports unlimited usage of one widget at a time. Multiple widget support is available as a small, one-time in-app purchase: please confirm that your favorite widgets are compatible with your watch before buying.\n\n\u2022 Although you'll be viewing and interacting with widgets on your watch, our app is essentially just \"screencasting\" them: the widgets themselves are actually still running on your phone. This means that any actions that result from tapping on a widget will also occur on your phone. This is fundamental and isn't a \"bug\" that can be \"fixed\". \n\n\u2022 Similarly, you\u2019ll find that taps and swipes on your watch take a bit longer than when you interact directly with your phone \u2013 there\u2019s some unavoidable lag in the connection between devices. Widgets will generally still be usable, just not quite as snappy.\n\n\u2022 Some widgets lend themselves better than others to the screen of a watch. Please use common sense.\n\n\u2022 There are also known compatibility issues with some specific widgets, including a few that don't update when your phone is asleep. This isn't a problem we can fix either - it's down to the developers of the widgets themselves - but you can find mitigation tips for all such issues at http://wearablewidgets.com/widgets.html\n\nUsing widgets on Wear OS\n\nWearable Widgets needs to be installed to both your phone and linked watch separately, as it is a full-fledged app on both devices. Start by tapping the big green Install button above; then, run the app on your phone, and you should be prompted to install it to your watch.\n\nOnce installed, there are 3 ways to use phone widgets on your watch:\n\u27a4 As a conventional app, from the launcher (from your watch face, press the watch\u2019s crown or main hardware button).\n\u27a4 As a watch face. Set WW as one of your \"favorite\" faces, and your widgets will always be just a swipe away.\n\u27a4 As complications in other, non-WW faces (2x2 and smaller widgets only).\n\nLots more details and instructions at http://wearablewidgets.com/wear\n\nDEPRECATED INTERFACES\n\nDevices in this section are those for which we have developed Wearable Widgets support in the past, but are not currently working on, for a variety of reasons.\n\nTizen Gear\nSamsung has stopped accepting updates to our Gear clients, so unfortunately we are unable to make any further improvements to our app on this platform. However, the watch apps still work, and are still available for most of these devices on the Samsung Gear app store; search for \u201cWearable Widgets\u201d to install.\n\nSony SmartWatch 1 and 2\nThese two early smartwatches from Sony were replaced by the SW3, running Android Wear, so we have migrated our Sony support to Wear also. If you're still using an SW1 or SW2, you'll need an older version of our app to make it work; download it from http://bit.ly/WW61sw2\n\nGoogle Glass\u2122\nOur Glass interface is still functional, but we stopped active development when Google discontinued Glass as a consumer product in early 2015. To use it, you'll need to sideload the WW Glassware; find the download at http://wearablewidgets.com/glass"}, {"name": "Weather 14 Days - Meteored", "description": "Trusted by millions of Android users around the world and hailed by meteorology fans, Weather 14 Days is the official free App from TheWeather.com (Meteored).

the alphabet of abvgdeyka and preschool learning to read by syllables and spells in Russian and Ukrainian languages. Preparing for school for children 3 - 4 years and older. We learn letters, syllables and learn to read in the process of an exciting educational game for children - preschoolers from 3 to 7 years old.\n\nEvil Snow Queen froze the magic letters of the alphabet and the animals were captured in the ice. And only your clever kid can save them, for which he must learn the letters of the alphabet and make words - the names of animals.\n\nCollecting letters from the alphabet of words, the child hears the sound of each letter of the alphabet, which allows the baby to subconsciously remember the letters and their sound. And after your clever znayka will save all the animals, a smart game is waiting for a cognitive game - a quiz in which a preschooler can consolidate his knowledge of letters and reading skills.\n\nAt the end of the quiz, the joyful rabbit will dance to your child a fiery dance, encouraging the child to continue the fun preschool learning to read!\n\nTECHNIQUE \n\nThe application uses an effective sound method of teaching reading, similar to the Zaitsev's cubes technique and the principles of the Montessori method, namely:\n\nWE DO NOT NEED A ALPHABET AND LETTERNESS. AND WE DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THE ALPHABET! \n\nTo learn to read, the baby does not need to know the names of the letters. A common phenomenon: my mother bought the alphabet for children or the primer, the child learned the letters, even learned the alphabet, but she could not read. Words he does not stick.\n\nFamous teacher Nikolai Zaitsev states - alphabet for kids is harmful! The alphabet and primer on each letter of the alphabet is given a picture: A is a stork, B is a hippopotamus, etc. When we learn to read by alphabet, the baby will remember both the letter and the picture, but how then to explain to him that a zebra - a stork - a lizard - a heron, flashing in his mind, should form the word \"hare\"? How to teach a child to read? \n\nInstead, in the \u201cLearning to read - Save the beasts\u201d application , the child learns not the alphabetical names of letters, but their \u201csound\u201d or sounds from which a baby can easily gather a word.\n\nThe game has 2 modes of teaching reading:\n1. Learn to spell - great for your child to learn the letters and understand the basics of reading. It is recommended to start with this training mode - it is very effective for memorizing letters and learning to read short words.\n2. Learn to read by syllables (storage) - for children who already know the letters. By \"syllables\", the technique of \"Zaitsev's cubes\" means \"warehouses\" - i.e. a combination of a consonant and a vowel: for example, co-ro-wah, co-sh-ka. Learning to read in such short syllables for a child is much easier than in complex \"school\" syllables. And the easier it is to learn to read - the more effective!\n\nWHAT YOUR BABY WILL LEARN: \n\n\u2022 Learn Russian letters fast and fun.\n\u2022 We develop phonematic hearing by collecting letters and listening to their sound.\n\u2022 We replenish vocabulary with many new words in Russian\n\u2022 Learn to read by syllables and spell\n\u2022 We learn a lot of new animals\n\u2022 We consolidate our reading skills during an exciting quiz.\n\u2022 We do not teach children the alphabet - we teach them to read!\n\u2022 Pre-school education and preparation for school for children from 4 years old for free\n\nThe interface of the educational game for children is built in accordance with the principle of the Montessori teaching system - \u201cHelp me do it myself!\u201d. It is so simple that a child from 3 years will deal with him in a minute and will be happy to smile and learn the letters of the alphabet on his own, and his happy parents will be able to take a break!\n\nLearning to read has never been so informative and interesting!\n\nThis free version of the educational game contains 4 learning levels. The full version contains all 16 learning levels, arranged by increasing word difficulty. If on the first level words consist of 2-3 letters, then on the last of 7-8 letters."}, {"name": "\u0424\u0438\u043b\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0434\u044b: \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432", "description": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0434\u044b -

Can you get to the end of the game by filling all the squares with words and filling the vessels with colored liquid?\n\nA whole bunch of levels hidden in bottles!\n\nOver 1000 levels prepared especially for you. At the beginning, solving a puzzle may seem like a snap. But, as the number of letters increases, guessing the words becomes harder and more fun. Funny monsters will tell you letters from a word, you just have to guess it.\n\nRULES OF THE GAME\n\nOn a square field there are letters. Find all the words by highlighting the letters next to them so that the words completely fill the square. Not all, but only hidden words are suitable for filling.\nIf you are confused and do not see words, then colored monsters will tell you where to start. With each level, the complexity of the game increases, and guessing words is more interesting.\n\nFileword - excellent entertainment, as well as smart and interesting games that will give you many hours of pleasure!\n\nA game for those who like to solve crosswords, play gallows, search for words, make words from words and letters, or just guess them.

People love it!\n\n\u221e Infinity Loop is the most trending game in 2019. It can be considered a puzzle game about creating intricate looping patterns or just the application of using a simple concept: \"connecting multiple things\" and make fun out of it.\n\nSome people say this game is a good puzzle game but with a great zen mode. The goal is to clear your mind, remove the stress from your daily life without any pressure or tension to solve the levels. \n\nIf you are looking for a stress relief or a relaxing game type, enjoy the loop!\n\nFAQ\n\nHow to Play Infinity Loop?\n\nConnect all the lines and corners to make perfect connections. It is like killing chaos and reaching perfection. Watch the video to overview how it works. Check on youtube as well where several people post the solutions. Nonetheless, we suggest you to try to find yourself how the game works and what are you supposed to do.\n\nHow to Play the Infinity Dark Mode?\n\nThe goal of the dark mode is to make disconnections, breaking it all and not leaving a single piece connected.\n\nHow many levels the game has?\n\nInfinite.\n\nHow can I save my game progress?\n\nMake sure you connect the app with Google Play Games on the settings panel (the button is in the bottom of the gameplay). This way your progress won't be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.\n\nDo I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?\n\nNo. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. Only if you opt for the secondary game, called \"black mode\", you may need to pay a coffee for it after level 100.\n\nI don't feel the game is challenging. Why?\n\nThe challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels.
