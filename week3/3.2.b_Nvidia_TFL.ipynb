    "## Transfer Learning revisited\n",
    "Today's main topic is *transfer learning*, an approach which lets you train application specific networks by building on networks that were trained on a different or more general domain (so called pre-trained networks). This allows the utilization of sophisticated networks based on just a comparatively small amount of data, thus solving tasks which would otherwise not be possible to solve - as demonstrated in connection with the CRISP-DM methodology in [this morning's notebook](3.2.a_CRISPDM_TFL.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see this in action once again and you will get hands-on experience using the [Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit), a small computer comparable to the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) but with a whole Developer Kit for AI applications provided by Nvidia."

    "Your task is to take the free [Jetson AI Fundamentals course](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-ai-certification-programs#course_outline) provided by the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute (DLI). Furthermore, the projects you have to work on for that course are such that they even deploy the models to be used in real time (albeit deployment happens at locally). You will, however, need a Jetson Nano and a USB camera for this - and THU will provide those for each exercise group!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**: You will be provided with the original 4GB version of the Nanos and most of the setup steps have already been done for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have finished the Nvidia course and sucessfully completed the quizzes associated with it, you will be able to print a first certificate. You are expected to complete the course and upload the certificate to prove it. If you so desire, you can actually use this as a first step towards getting certified as a *Jetson AI Specialist* as detailed on the course page linked above."

    "* if you run Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) on your computer, you can download and install [RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/de/connect/download/viewer/linux/) as well. On the other hand, there might already be a pre-installed VNC viewer on your system (check for yourselves). Or, if you would like a viewer whcih can deal with other *remote desktop protocols* as well, check out [Remmina](https://remmina.org/). In most distributions you can just install it from the accompanying repos."
