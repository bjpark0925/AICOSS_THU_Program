With [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), there is an entire ecosystem for R that is geared towards tidy data. However, with the flexibility of Python and Pandas, we can also convert our data into a tidy format without too much effort."

A dataset is a collection of **values**, which can be either numeric or categorical in nature. These values can always be assigned to a **variable** and an **observation**. A variable contains all values that measure one and the same underlying attribute (such as altitude, temperature, duration). An observation contains all values that are measured in the same unit (such as a person or a day) across different attributes.\n",
