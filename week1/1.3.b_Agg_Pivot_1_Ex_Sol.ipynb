    "Suppose you had a column in a data frame in which the days of the week are entered with the abbreviations `MO, TU, WE, ..., SA, SO` instead of the numbers 1-7. What could you do to ensure that these values are output in the desired order when using this column in pivot tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** You could solve this as follows (the column name is `Weekday`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df[\"Weekday\"] = df[\"Weekday\"].astype(\"category\")\n",

    "What do you think of the pivot tables in cells 6-8? In your answer, please explain in particular the use of the 'Zip Code' column and the aggregate function used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** In the pivot tables, the standard aggregate function `mean` is used for all columns that have a numeric data type. Presumably `sum` would be more suitable as an aggregate function here. Above all, however, aggregating the column `Zip Code` makes no sense at all, as this is certainly not a measure that can be used for calculations."

    "Does it make sense to use the aggregate function `len` for the attribute `Residential Units` (e.g. in cell 22)? What could possibly go wrong here?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The use of `len` would correspond to the use of `COUNT` in SQL and is therefore *not* sensible, because you have to add up, as there are numbers greater than 1. For clarification, repeat cell 22 with `np.sum` instead of `len`."
